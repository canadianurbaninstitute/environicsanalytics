\title{Split Large Geographies into Smaller Pieces}
\usage{
.split_large_geographies(
  geography,
  max_area_sqft = 5e+06,
  safety_factor = 1.05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{geography}{An sf object containing one or more spatial features}

\item{max_area_sqft}{Numeric. Maximum area in square feet for each piece.
Default is 5000000 (5 million square feet)}

\item{safety_factor}{Numeric. Safety factor for grid calculation, applied when
splitting features. Default is 1.05. Higher values create smaller grid cells
to ensure pieces stay below the maximum area}
}
\value{
An sf object with all features below max_area_sqft. Split features will
  have suffixed names (e.g., "original_name_1", "original_name_2")
}
\description{
Main function to process an sf object and split any features exceeding the
maximum area threshold of the Environics Analytics API into smaller pieces.
Features below the threshold are retained unchanged.
